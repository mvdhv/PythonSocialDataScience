DPIR (open to other Oxford department's as well) postgraduate students are encouraged to attend a 6-week course to learn the programming language Python in Hillary Term 2023. Python programming knowledge is becoming increasingly essential for Social Scientists working on applications for computational social science research, such as machine learning and computational text analysis. 

The structure of the course will be a 2-hour Python class and 1-hour Python clinic for code de-bugging purposes and project presentations. This will take place on Tuesdays from 4pm-7pm.

Important note: Attendance of this course is obligatory if you want to attend the Computational Text Analysis Class offered in Trinity 2023 (You can get an exemption if you show previous attendance of a Python class through a transcript or similar document). These two classes can be viewed as a sequence.

The course material is publicly available. For each class you will find:

1. Lecture Slides
2. Code used in the Python Session in class + its full solutions
3. Excercises + their solutions


The class has a Slack Channel, students have been sent a link over email! Please email me if you would like to join (ashrakat.elshehawy@politics.ox.ac).

To sign up for presentations please refer to our slack channel.
